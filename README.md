NOMotion - Motion Rig Plugin for Nuclear Option

This is a simple plugin that sends your aircrafts angular velocities via UDP socket.

Requires BepInEx 5.

You can configure 3 things:

- kill switch to turn off sending
- UDP Port
- IP Address of the Server that's expecting the packets

You can either configure these with BepInEx Configuration Manager, or in BepInEx/config/NOMotion.cfg
